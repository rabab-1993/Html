        Warning: Most images are copyrighted. Do not display an image on your webpage unless:
        <ul>

            <li>
                
                You own the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have received explicit, written permission from the image owner.
            </li>
            <li>
                You have ample proof that the image is, in fact, in the public domain.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        Copyright violations are illegal and unethical. In addition, never point your src attribute at an image hosted on someone else's website that you don't have permission to link to. This is called "hotlinking". Again, stealing someone's bandwidth is illegal. It also slows down your page, leaving you with no control over whether the image is removed or replaced with something embarrassing.
